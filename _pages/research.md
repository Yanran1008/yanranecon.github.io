 * [**Time Variation in the News-Returns Relationship**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3420981)

   The well-documented underreaction of stock prices to news exhibits substan- tial time variation. Higher risk-bearing capacity of financial intermediaries, lower passive ownership of stocks, and more informative news increase price responses to contemporaneous news; surprisingly, they also increase price responses to lagged news (underreaction). Our findings are not driven by short-sale constraints, serial correlation in news flow, or improved information processing capacity. We discuss possible mechanisms based on investor behavior and strategic order-splitting by institutions. A simple model with limited attention and three investor types – in- stitutional, non-institutional, passive – predicts the varying response to news we observe.
