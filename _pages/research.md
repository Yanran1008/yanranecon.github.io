## Working Papers

1. **Neoclassical Growth Transition Dynamics with One-Sided Commitment** (with Dirk Krueger and Harald Uhlig) 
   [\[paper\]](../files/Krueger_Li_Uhlig_paper_20220401.pdf) [\[slides\]](../files/Krueger_Li_Uhlig_slides_20220401.pdf)  

   This paper characterizes the transition dynamics of a continuous-time neoclassical production economy with capital accumulation in which households face idiosyncratic income risk. Insurance companies operating in perfectly competitive markets offer long-term insurance contracts and can commit to future contractual obligations, whereas households cannot. Therefore the equilibrium features imperfect insurance and a non-degenerate cross-sectional consumption distribution. When household labor productivity takes two values, one of which is zero, and the utility function is logarithmic, we show that the transition dynamics induced by unexpected positive or negative technology shocks, including the evolution of the consumption distribution, can be calculated in closed form, as long as the initial deviation from the steady state is not too large. This is in contrast to both the standard representative agent neoclassical growth model as well as Bewley (1986) style models with uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk.  Thus the paper provides an analytically tractable alternative to the standard incomplete markets general equilibrium model developed in Aiyagari (1994) by retaining its physical structure, but substituting the assumed incomplete asset markets structure with one in which limits to consumption insurance emerge endogenously, as in the macroeconomic literature on limited commitment.  

2. **Time Variation in the News-Returns Relationship** (with Paul Glasserman and Harry Mamaysky)
   [\[paper\]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3420981) [\[internet appendix\]](../files/Glasserman_Li_Mamaysky_internet_appendix_20220314.pdf) [\[model appendix\]](../files/Glasserman_Li_Mamaysky_model_20220314.pdf)  

   The well-documented underreaction of stock prices to news exhibits substantial time variation. Higher risk-bearing capacity of financial intermediaries, lower passive ownership of stocks, and more informative news increase price responses to contemporaneous news; surprisingly, they also increase price responses to lagged news (underreaction). Our findings are not driven by short-sale constraints, serial correlation in news flow, or improved information processing capacity. We discuss possible mechanisms based on investor behavior and strategic order-splitting by institutions. A simple model with limited attention and three investor types -- institutional, non-institutional, passive -- predicts the varying response to news we observe.
