## Job Market Paper
1. [Taxing Top Incomes in the World of Entrepreneurs]()

   \[[Paper]()\]
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>   
   This paper shows that high top marginal income tax rates generate large aggregate output and productivity losses. These losses arise because taxes distort the investment decisions of entrepreneurs, who constitute a large share of high income earners. I identify two novel distortions. The first is the "productivity investment effect". Top income tax rates distort the productivity investment decisions not only of entrepreneurs who are already in the top income bracket but also of those who will become top earners in the future by building up their firms. The second force is the "incorporation timing effect". Successful entrepreneurs grow their firms and then sell their businesses to the corporate sector through incorporation. High top tax rates push these entrepreneurs to sell before their firms reach their full productivity potential. This force is driven by a feature of the tax code: the sale of a firm is treated as capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. Both effects imply that even though it targets only a small fraction of households, increasing the top marginal income tax rate generates large output costs by decreasing productivity. Since lower productivity erodes the tax base, in a calibrated model, the revenue-maximizing top income tax rate is 45%.

1. [Inheritance, Wealth Distribution, and Estate Taxation](../files/Inheritance.pdf)

   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   The estate tax has been considered by its supporters as a natural way to reduce wealth inequality because it targets the wealthy directly. However, this conclusion relies heavily on the underlying assumption that inheritance plays a crucial role in wealth accumulation for the rich. Using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, this paper exhibits novel evidence about wealthy households and the inheritance they have received. Specifically: 1) less than 14% of the richest one percent's wealth is directly attributable to inheritances. 2) More than half of the top one percent by wealth do not receive any inheritances over their lifetime. Then, in a quantitative model that accounts for novel facts on inheritance received by the rich, this paper finds that even if the estate tax rate were raised to 100 percent, the top one percent wealth holding would drop by only 3.5 percentage points. Moreover, compared with taxing the incomes of the top one percent earners, taxing estates generates a large output loss for a given amount of wealth redistribution, suggesting that estate taxation may not be an effective tool for wealth redistribution.
